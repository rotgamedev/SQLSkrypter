# Skrypter
Skrypter is software that is used to execute SQL queries on MSSQL databases. The software allows you to add multiple servers, on which many databases can be located, and execute scripts on them. The query can be written from within the application or imported from a file. The application informs about the correct or incorrect execution of the query by means of color markings as well as saving in "* .log" files.

The application opens in the 800x600 format. Its size cannot be changed. The default application location is in the center of the screen. The location can be changed by grabbing the application title (SKRYPTER) with the cursor and moving it to any place.

Principle of operation:

The Skrypter sends a query to previously configured servers returning the names of databases located on the given server

The default query text on first run is:
`"SELECT * FROM master.sys.databases where state_desc = 'ONLINE' order by name"`
###### Important: You should pay attention to what query will be written, as incorrect query may cause an application error.

The application checks for updates at startup. If there is a newer version, the user will be notified. Checking for updates is done once at the start of the application. The ability to check for updates at startup can be disabled by unchecking the box: Check for updates at application startup. An internet connection is required for this.

The application has different language versions. The language can be changed by selecting it from the list. Changing the language does not require restarting the application. Currently, you can choose Polish or English language.
